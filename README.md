Project Status
--------------

I work on my personal website when I get a chance.

I welcome your input. The goal of the project is to become a better tester, developer, help others, and have fun.

If you would like to contribute, read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/StewShack/PersonalWebsiteGatsby/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and create an issue. We can discuss the issue and then move forward on a pull request.

To run the site:

```
npm install

npm test

npm start
```
