Congratulations, you completed the bowling game! Now what? Go bowling, have fun,
enjoy life!

Write down your score, and write a test for it. It's always a good idea to write
a test that covers a [typical situation](/post/bowlinggame-typical).

Here are some other things that I would like to try:

* [A test for the perfect game.](/post/bowlinggame-perfect)
* [Change int[] to List&lt;int&gt;.](/post/bowlinggame-genericlist)
* [Use guard clauses instead of else statements.](/post/bowlinggame-guard)
* Save the score to the database and use the Theory attribute to test it.
