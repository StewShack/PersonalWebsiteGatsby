Congratulations, you completed the bowling game! Now what? Go bowling, have fun,
enjoy life!

Write down your score, and write a test for it. It's always a good idea to write
a test that covers a [](typical.htm">typical situation).

Here are some other things that I would like to try:

* [A test for the perfect game.](/bowlinggame/perfect/)
* [Change int[] to List&lt;int&gt;.](/bowlinggame/genericlist/)
* [Use guard clauses instead of else statements.](/bowlinggame/guard/)
* Save the score to the database and use the Theory attribute to test it.
